# Wendy Hudson Author Website

This project is a personal learning exercise where I took a concept from design to code, building a fully functional website for an author. The author, Wendy Hudson, is a friend who kindly agreed to be the subject of this project. The content on the site is a mix of real and fictional elements, as the primary goal was to practice the full development process.

## Project Goals

The main objective of this project was to gain hands-on experience with the following:

1. **Concept to Code Workflow**: Starting from an idea, creating a design, and implementing it in code.
2. **Figma for Design**: Learning the basics of Figma to create a visual design for the website.
3. **Tailwind CSS**: Using Tailwind CSS for styling and understanding its utility-first approach.
4. **React**: Building the website using React, including component-based architecture and routing with React Router.
5. **Client Simulation**: Simulating a real-world client project to practice communication, planning, and execution.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive, ensuring a great user experience across devices.
- **Dynamic Navigation**: A mobile-friendly navigation bar with a hamburger menu.
- **Hero Section**: A visually captivating hero section introducing the author and their work.
- **Books Section**: A placeholder section for showcasing the author's books.
- **Feature Section**: Highlights the author's latest book with reviews and praise.
- **Blog and Events Pages**: Placeholder pages for future content.
- **Buy Now Button**: A call-to-action button linking to the author's Amazon page.
- **Reusable Components**: Components like `SectionWrapper` ensure consistent styling across sections.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Figma**: Used for designing the layout and visual elements of the website.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the website with a utility-first approach.
- **React**: For building the website with reusable components and dynamic routing.
- **React Router**: For managing navigation between pages.
- **Vite**: For fast development and build processes.
- **ESLint**: For maintaining code quality and consistency.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure with the following key directories:

- **`src/components`**: Contains reusable components like `Hero`, `Feature`, `BooksSection`, and `BuyNowButton`.
- **`src/pages`**: Contains individual pages like `Home`, `About`, `Books`, `Blog`, and `Events`.
- **`src/layout`**: Contains layout components like `Navbar` and `Footer`.
- **`src/assets`**: Stores images and other static assets.
- **`src`**: Includes the main entry point (`main.jsx`) and global styles (`App.css`).

## Lessons Learned

1. **Design to Code Transition**: Translating a Figma design into a functional website helped me understand the importance of planning and design consistency.
2. **Tailwind CSS**: I became comfortable with Tailwind's utility classes and how they speed up the styling process.
3. **React Components**: Building reusable components improved my understanding of React's component-based architecture.
4. **Routing**: Implementing navigation with React Router gave me insight into managing dynamic routes.
5. **Simulating a Client Project**: This exercise helped me prepare for working with real clients by practicing the full development process.

## Future Improvements

- Add real content and images for a more polished and complete website.
- Implement additional features like a contact form or newsletter subscription.
- Optimize for performance and accessibility.
- Expand the Books section to dynamically display book data from an API or CMS.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev`.
4. Open the website in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Acknowledgments

- **Wendy Hudson**: For allowing me to use her as the subject of this project.
- **Open Source Tools**: Tailwind CSS, React, and Vite for making the development process efficient and enjoyable.

This project has been an invaluable learning experience, and I look forward to applying these skills to real-world projects in the future.
